## Taking user input and converting to float
A = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
B = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Logic
Addition = A + B
Subtraction = A - B
Multiplication = A * B
Division = A / B

# Displaying the results
print("Addition: " ,Addition)
print("Subtraction: " ,Subtraction)
print("Multiplication: " ,Multiplication)
print("Division: " , Division)
