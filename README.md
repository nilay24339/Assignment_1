Task 1

Basic Arithmetic Calculator
A lightweight Python script that performs fundamental mathematical operations based on user input. This project demonstrates basic data handling, type conversion, and arithmetic logic in Python.

 Features
The program calculates four primary operations using two user-provided numbers:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

 How it Works
The script follows a standard Input-Process-Output (IPO) model:

Input: The program uses the input() function to prompt the user for two values.

Conversion: Since input() returns data as a string, the values are wrapped in float() to allow for decimal-point calculations.

Processing: The script assigns the results of the four math operations to specific variables.

Output: The final results are printed to the console with descriptive labels.


Task 2

Greeting Program in Python
A simple Python script designed to practice string manipulation and user interaction. It captures a user's first and last name separately and combines them into a personalized greeting.

Functionality
The script performs the following steps:

Prompts the user to input their First Name.

Prompts the user to input their Last Name.

Concatenates (joins) the two strings with a space in between to create a full name.

Displays a welcome message using the generated full name.

Logic Breakdown
input(): This function is used to collect data from the user. By default, it treats all input as a String.

Concatenation (+): Unlike the calculator program where + added numbers, here the + operator joins text strings together.

Variable Assignment: The results are stored in full_name to keep the code clean and organized.
